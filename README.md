# Secret Hitler board game role distribution

Welcome to my final project for the CS50x course, and my first GitHub project! This is a simple website that's to be used to distribute roles for the board game Secret Hitler. The user selects the number of players, enters the player names, and passes the device around the room so each player gets to see their role.

This was my first experience using Flask and JavaScript from scratch. There are very likely many, many areas of improvement, and I might come back to them after having learned more about these languages and framwork.
